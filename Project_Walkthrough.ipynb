    "## 1. Problem Definition & Objective\n",
    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "Traditional cultural education is often static (textbooks) or unengaging. While Generative AI can create stories, it often suffers from \"hallucinations\" (inventing historical facts) and relies on expensive cloud APIs that fail under heavy load or budget constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "To develop a **Hybrid AI Multimodal Agent** that:\n",
    "1.  **Grounds** storytelling in real-time historical data (RAG).\n",
    "2.  **Synthesizes** cinematic video and professional voiceover.\n",
    "3.  **Guarantees Uptime** by automatically switching from Cloud (Gemini) to Local (Llama 3) inference if rate limits are hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Relevance:**\n",
    "This system serves as a low-cost, resilient educational tool for preserving oral traditions and folklore in a digital, immersive format."

    "## 2. Data Understanding & Preparation\n",
    "The system relies on three distinct data streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Historical Grounding (Text):** Fetched via `wikipedia-api`. We extract the first 1000 characters of a country's history section to use as a factual basis for the LLM.\n",
    "* **Geospatial Data (Location):** `geopy` (Nominatim) converts raw Lat/Lon coordinates from the 3D globe into specific Country/Region names.\n",
    "* **Cultural Data (Structured):** A dataset of Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions (Power Distance, Individualism, etc.) used to generate the Radar Chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning Pipeline:**\n",
    "Raw LLM output is often \"dirty\" (containing Markdown backticks or Python-style single quotes). We implemented a custom regex cleaning pipeline (`clean_json_response`) to sanitize this into valid JSON."
